\f0\fs24 \cf0 Patch Notes\
From document Bug and Enhancements\
Entry 3: Animation Line 25: Something was being passed between files without being protected in anyway.\
	Action: Found the method being called searched all files for a call found a variable being passed to setFrames() without a accessibility modifier all the other variables being passed were private so I set this one(Diamond file, Variable sprites) to private. Files appear to still function as intended.\
\
Entry 6: Menu State Line 70: To me this looks like the menu option to exit the game at the beginning.\
	Action: Leaving as is.\
\
Entry 8: Content Lines 14-15, 17-20, 22: Looks to be simple readability issues.\
	Action: Cannot set as protected(Breaks items in other files) After glancing at the other files it appears that the 2D arrays here are not edited once I set them to be final.\
\
Entry 9: Data Line 8: Simple accessibility problem.\
	Action: Set \'93time\'94 as protected instead of public(Didn\'92t appear to break anything).\
\
File: EntityTest.java\
	Changes made: Added more tests to methods testSetLeft(), testSetRight(), testSetUp(), testSetDown(), testValidateNextPosition(). Implemented testGetNextPosition(), testUpdate() methods.\
